# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following assets for the Street Eye app:

## Required Assets

1. **icon.png** - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
   - Used as the main app icon

2. **splash.png** - Splash screen image
   - Recommended size: 1242x2436px (or appropriate for your target devices)
   - Background color: #254A48 (Deep Teal Green)

3. **adaptive-icon.png** - Android adaptive icon foreground (1024x1024px)
   - Background color: #254A48

4. **favicon.png** - Web favicon (48x48px or larger)

## Notes

- All images should be in PNG format
- Use the app's color scheme (#254A48 for primary elements)
- Ensure icons are clear and recognizable at small sizes
- For production, consider creating icons for different screen densities

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can use placeholder images or Expo's default assets. The app will work without these, but you should add proper assets before production release.
